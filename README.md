## ðŸ¤” Why

The goal of the project is to create a place where I could put my old poems and be available online for anyone to see

## âœˆ What is

The site consists of a page with the list of poems, where each poem leads to his page with the content.  

Text files were used as a source of data for the poems and the images are from a free external bank, using all the power of Next.js to create the static pages of each poem and optimizing the images.

## ðŸš€ Technology

*As main tools, were used:*

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to create all views
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) to the all web front end
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) To facilitate future changes
